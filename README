## Hi, it's me. 

The challenge: to build out the QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The task: to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder (Desktop version of the design).
The required were assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
There is a `style-guide.md` file containing the information, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building the project
The project was done in Visual Studio Code using HTML and CSS.
